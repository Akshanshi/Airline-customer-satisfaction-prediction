# Airline-customer-satisfaction-prediction
Airline customer satisfaction prediction (classification) this is a classification model used to predict if the customer is satisfied with the service or not.
With the help of various python based machine learning and data science tools we're going to analyse and train the data. Then I made an attempt to build a machine learning model based on our information. The ML model will help us to predict whether a passenger is satisfied with the airline service or not. i have made both front end html code and python code 

In this we're going to follow-

1. Defining Problem
2. Briefing about Data
3. Importing Data
4. Data Exploration
5. Data Summarisation
6. Modelling
7. Experimentation & Evaluation
8. Conclusion & References
